## 🚀 About Me

I’m a **doctoral researcher** exploring cutting-edge **AI and robotic perception**, focused on creating intelligent systems that perceive and navigate the world in all its complexity. My work bridges **radar perception, embodied AI, and 3D computer vision and probabilistic machine learning**, with applications in autonomous navigation and heavy machinery automation.

🌟 Inspired by *Iron Man*, I thrive on solving challenges where **chaos meets clarity** to uncover manifold possibilities.

- 🔭 **Current Focus**:  
  - Working with automotive imaging radar for robust state estimation using low level raw data.
  - Multi-modal sensor fusion and calibration 
  - World models that integrate **radar, IMU, cameras and LiDAR** seamlessly.  
  - Extending my **environment perception and state estimation in challenging scenarios** research with uncertainty aware deep learning.

- 🌱 **Learning Goals**:  
  - Exploring probabilistic, complex value, graph and sequence based neural architectures and their application to autonomous navigation  
  - Understanding the deeper meaning of ancient wisdom in a modern context.
